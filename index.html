               <h2>Fret the low E string at the fifth fret.</h2>
                <p>
                The low E string, also called the sixth string, 
                is the lowest and thickest string on your guitar.
                The note at the fifth fret of the low E is the same as the open A string, the next string over from the low E.
                For this method, it isn't necessary to first tune your low E string. 
                Even though your instrument may not be to concert pitch or absolute pitch, the strings will be tuned to each other. 
                Anything you play will "sound right," as long as you're playing by yourself and not with another instrument tuned to concert pitch.
                </p>
                
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <h2>Match the open A string to the low E string at the fifth fret.</h2>
               
                <p>
                Listen to the sound coming from the low E string, then play the open A string. 
                Tune the open A string up or down until it matches the sound coming from the low E string.
                If the open A string is higher than the A you play at the fifth fret of the low E string, 
                tune it down and then bring it back up.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li> 
                <h2>Repeat the same process to tune the D and G strings.</h2>
                <p>
                 
                Once you have the A in tune, fret it at the fifth fret and pluck it. 
                This is a D. Pluck the open D string, and tune the it up or down to match.
                When the D string is in tune, fret it at the fifth fret to play a G. 
                Pluck the open G string and compare. Tune it up or down to match the sound.
                </p>

                <h2>Fret the G string at the fourth fret to tune the B string.</h2>
                <p>
                     
                    The process changes somewhat for the B string, because there is a shorter interval between G and B. 
                    Fret the G string at the fourth fret to play a B. Pluck the open B string and compare the sounds.
                    Tune the open B string up or down until it matches the sound produced on the G string.                
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Return to the fifth fret to tune the high E string.</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    Once you have the B string in tune, fret it at the fifth fret and pluck to play a high E. 
                    Tune the open high E string up or down to match the sound coming from the B string.
                    If the open high E string is higher in pitch than the high E played on the B string,
                    tune it down and then bring it up to pitch slowly and gradually. 
                    he high E string has a lot of tension and will snap easily.
